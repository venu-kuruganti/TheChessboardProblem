# TheChessboardProblem

Suppose you have a chessboard and you place 1 grain of rice on the first square. Then you place 2 grains of rice on the second square and then 4 grains of rice on the third square and 8 grains of rice on the fourth square with the number of grains doubling every square, what will be the number of grains on the very last or 64th square?

The answer is in this small console project!
